Release Notes.

## 0.7.0

### File System Changes

### Bugs

- Fix the filtering of stream in descending order by timestamp.

- Fix the bug that the data node can't re-register to etcd when the connection is lost.
- Fix memory leak in sorting the stream by the inverted index.

- Fix the bug that segment's reference count is increased twice when the controller try to create an existing segment.
- Fix a bug where a distributed query would return an empty result if the "limit" was set much lower than the "offset".
- Fix duplicated measure data in a single part.
- Fix several "sync.Pool" leak issues by adding a tracker to the pool.
- Fix panic when removing a expired segment.
- Fix panic when reading a disorder block of measure. This block's versions are not sorted in descending order.

### Documentation
