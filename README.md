BanyanDB, as an observability database, aims to ingest, analyze and store Metrics, Tracing and Logging data.
It's designed to handle observability data generated by Observability platform and APM system, like [Apache SkyWalking](https://github.com/apache/skywalking) etc.

## Introduction

BanyanDB, as an observability database, aims to ingest, analyze and store Metrics, Tracing, and Logging data. It's designed to handle observability data generated by Apache SkyWalking. Before BanyanDB emerges, the Databases that SkyWalking adopted are not ideal for the APM data model, especially for saving tracing and logging data. Consequently, Thereâ€™s room to improve the performance and resource usage based on the nature of SkyWalking data patterns.

The database research community usually uses [RUM conjecture](http://daslab.seas.harvard.edu/rum-conjecture/) to describe how a database access data. In this talk, I will share the details about BanyanDB based on this conjecture, explaining why BanyanDB is more effective and reliable than other storage layers.
