# Delete Data in [Measures](../concept/data-model.md#measures) and [Streams](../concept/data-model.md#streams)

Due to the design of BanyanDB, the `Property` data provides [CRUD](./bydbctl/property.md) operations,
but the data in the `Measures and Streams` can not be deleted directly.
The data will be deleted automatically based on the [Groups](../concept/data-model.md#groups) `TTL` setting.

The TTL means the `time to live` of the data in the group. 
Each group has an internal trigger which is triggered by writing events. If there is no further data, the expired data canâ€™t get removed.

For example, the following command will create a group with a TTL of 7 days:
```shell
bydbctl group create -f - <<EOF
metadata:
  name: sw_metric
catalog: CATALOG_MEASURE
resource_opts:
  shard_num: 2
  segment_interval:
    unit: UNIT_DAY
    num: 1
  ttl:
    unit: UNIT_DAY
    num: 7
EOF
```
The data in this group will keep 7 days.

If you want to change the `TTL` of the data in this group to be 1 day, use the command:

```shell
bydbctl group update -f - <<EOF
metadata:
  name: sw_metric
catalog: CATALOG_MEASURE
resource_opts:
  shard_num: 2
  segment_interval:
    unit: UNIT_DAY
    num: 1
  ttl:
    unit: UNIT_DAY
    num: 1
EOF
```

More ttl units can be found in the [IntervalRule.Unit](../api-reference.md#intervalruleunit).

You can also manage the Group by other clients such as [Web-UI](./web-ui/schema/group.md) or [Java-Client](java-client.md).
