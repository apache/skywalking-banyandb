# Dashboard
The Web UI is hosted at [skywalking-banyandb-webapp](http://localhost:17913/) when you boot up the BanyanDB server.

On the dashboard page, You can view the BanyanDB running status, including the nodes' info and resource usage.
This feature requires setting the `observability-modes` flag to `native` when starting the BanyanDB server. More details can be found in the [observability](../../observability.md) document.
