# Logging

BanyanDB uses the [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) library for logging. The log level can be set using the `log-level` flag. The supported log levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. The default log level is `info`.

`logging-env` is used to set the logging environment. The default value is `prod`. The logging environment can be set to `dev` for development or `prod` for production. The logging environment affects the log format and output. In the `dev` environment, logs are output in a human-readable format, while in the `prod` environment, logs are output in JSON format.

`logging-modules` and `logging-levels` are used to set the log level for specific modules. The `logging-modules` flag is a comma-separated list of module names, and the `logging-levels` flag is a comma-separated list of log levels corresponding to the module names. The log level for a specific module can be set using these flags. Available modules are `storage`, `distributed-query`, `liaison-grpc`, `liaison-http`, `measure`, `stream`, `trace`, `metadata`, `property-schema-registry`, `metrics`, `pprof-service`, `query`, `server-queue-sub`, `server-queue-pub`. For example, to set the log level for the `storage` module to `debug`, you can use the following flags:

```sh
--logging-modules=storage --logging-levels=debug
```

## Slow Query Logging

BanyanDB supports slow query logging. The `slow-query` flag is used to set the slow query threshold. If a query takes longer than the threshold, it will be logged as a slow query. The default value is `0`, which means no slow query logging. This flag is only used for the data and standalone servers.

The `dst-slow-query` flag is used to set the distributed slow query threshold. This flag is only used for the liaison server. The default value is `5s`; set it to `0` to disable distributed slow query logging.

When query tracing is enabled, the slow query log won't be generated.
