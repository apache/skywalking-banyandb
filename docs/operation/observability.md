# Observability

This document outlines the observability features of BanyanDB, which include metrics, profiling, and tracing. These features help monitor and understand the performance, behavior, and overall health of BanyanDB.

## Logging

BanyanDB uses the [zerolo](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) library for logging. The log level can be set using the `log-level` flag. The supported log levels are `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal`. The default log level is `info`.

`logging-env` is used to set the logging environment. The default value is `prod`. The logging environment can be set to `dev` for development or `prod` for production. The logging environment affects the log format and output. In the `dev` environment, logs are output in a human-readable format, while in the `prod` environment, logs are output in JSON format.

`logging-modules` and `logging-levels` are used to set the log level for specific modules. The `logging-modules` flag is a comma-separated list of module names, and the `logging-levels` flag is a comma-separated list of log levels corresponding to the module names. The log level for a specific module can be set using these flags. Available modules are `storage`, `distributed-query`, `liaison-grpc`, `liaison-http`, `measure`, `stream`, `metadata`, `etcd-client`, `etcd-server`, `schema-registry`, `metrics`, `pprof-service`, `query`, `server-queue-sub`, `server-queue-pub`. For example, to set the log level for the `storage` module to `debug`, you can use the following flags:

```sh
--logging-modules=storage --logging-levels=debug
```

### Slow Query Logging

BanyanDB supports slow query logging. The `slow-query` flag is used to set the slow query threshold. If a query takes longer than the threshold, it will be logged as a slow query. The default value is `0`, which means no slow query logging. This flag is only used for the data and standalone servers.

The `dst-slow-query` flag is used to set the distributed slow query threshold. This flag is only used for the liaison server. The default value is `0`, which means no distributed slow query logging.

When query tracing is enabled, the slow query log won't be generated.

## Metrics

BanyanDB expose metrics for monitoring and analysis. In this part, we use some variables to represent the metrics, such as `$job` and `$instance`. The `$job` is the job name of the BanyanDB collection job, and the `$instance` is the instance name of the BanyanDB instance.

`__rate_interval` is a variable that represents the rate interval. It is used to calculate the rate of metrics.

### Stats

`Stats` metrics are used to monitor the overall status of BanyanDB. The following metrics are available:

#### Write Rate

The write rate is the number of write operations per second. It is calculated by summing the total number of written operations for measures and streams.

**Expression**: `sum(rate(banyandb_measure_total_written{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval])) + sum(rate(banyandb_stream_tst_total_written{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval]))`

#### Total Memory

The total memory is the total memory available on the system.

**Expression**: `sum(banyandb_system_memory_state{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\",kind=\"total\"})`

#### Disk Usage

The disk usage is the percentage of disk space used. If the disk usage is over 80%, it may indicate that the disk is almost full.

**Expression**: `sum(banyandb_system_disk{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\",kind=\"used\"})`

#### Query Rate

The query rate is the number of query operations per second. It is the query rate on the liaison server.

#### Etcd Operation Rate

The etcd operation rate is the number of etcd operations per second. It is calculated by summing the total number of etcd operations.

**Expression**: `sum(rate(banyandb_liaison_grpc_total_registry_started{job=~\"$job\",instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval])) + sum(rate(banyandb_liaison_grpc_total_started{job=~\"$job\",instance=~\"$instance\",method!=\"query\"}[$__rate_interval]))`

#### Active Instances

The active instances is the number of active instances in the BanyanDB cluster.

**Expression**: `sum(min_over_time(up{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval])) by (job)`

### Resource Usage

`Resource Usage` metrics are used to monitor the resource usage of BanyanDB on the node. The following metrics are available:

#### CPU Usage

The CPU usage is the percentage of CPU used. If the CPU usage is over 80%, it may indicate that the CPU is overloaded.

**Expression**: `max(rate(process_cpu_seconds_total{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval]) / banyandb_system_cpu_num{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\"}) by (job)`

#### RSS memory usage

The RSS memory usage is the percentage of resident memory used. If the memory usage is over 80%, it may indicate that the memory is almost full.

#### Disk Usage

The disk usage is the percentage of disk space used. If the disk usage is over 80%, it may indicate that the disk is almost full.

**Expression**: `max(sum(banyandb_system_disk{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\", kind=\"used\"}) / sum(banyandb_system_memory_state{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\", kind=\"total\"})) by (job)`

### Storage

`Storage` metrics are used to monitor the storage status of BanyanDB. The following metrics are available:

#### Write Rate

The write rate is the number of write operations per second. It is calculated by summing the total number of written operations for measures and streams. It's grouped by the `group` tag.

You can view the write rate of different instance to find out the hot instance.

**Expression**: `sum(rate(banyandb_measure_total_written{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval])) by (group) + sum(rate(banyandb_stream_tst_total_written{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval])) by (group)`

#### Query Latency

The query latency is the average query latency in seconds. It is calculated by summing the total query latency and dividing by the total number of queries.

You can view the query latency of different instance to find out the instance with high query latency. Because BanyanDB will fetch all instances to query, the query latency of the instance with high query latency will affect the overall query latency.

**Expression**: `sum(rate(banyandb_liaison_grpc_total_latency{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\",method=\"query\"}[$__rate_interval])) by( group) / sum(rate(banyandb_liaison_grpc_total_started{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\",method=\"query\"}[$__rate_interval])) by (group)`

#### Total Data

The total data is the total number of data points stored in BanyanDB. It's grouped by the `group` tag.

You can view the total data of different instance to find out the instance with high data points. If the difference between the total data of different instances is too large, it may indicate that the data is not evenly distributed.

**Expression1**: `sum(banyandb_measure_total_file_elements{job=~\"$job\",instance=~\"$instance\"})by(group)`
**Expression2**: `sum(banyandb_stream_tst_total_file_elements{job=~\"$job\",instance=~\"$instance\"})by(group)`

#### Merge File Rate

The merge file rate is the number of merge file operations per minute. It is calculated by summing the total number of merge file operations. It's grouped by the `group` tag.

If the value surges, it may indicate that too many small files are being merged. It may bring following problems:

- Increase the disk I/O
- Slow down the query performance
- Increase the CPU usage

**Expression1**: `sum(rate(banyandb_measure_total_merge_loop_started{job=~\"$job\",instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval]))by(group) * 60`

#### Merge File Partitions

The merge file partitions is the average number of partitions merged per merge file operation. It is calculated by summing the total number of partitions merged and dividing by the total number of merge file operations. It's grouped by the `group` tag.

If the value surges, it may indicate that too many partitions are being merged. It may because the partition number is too large that indicates the server is under a high write load.

**Expression1**: `sum(rate(banyandb_measure_total_merged_parts{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\",type=\"file\"}[$__rate_interval]))by(group) / sum(rate(banyandb_measure_total_merge_loop_started{job=~\"$job\",instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval]))by(group)`

**Expression2**: `sum(rate(banyandb_stream_tst_total_merged_parts{job=~\"$job\", instance=~\"$instance\",type=\"file\"}[$__rate_interval]))by(group) / sum(rate(banyandb_stream_tst_total_merge_loop_started{job=~\"$job\",instance=~\"$instance\"}[$__rate_interval]))by(group)`

## Metrics Providers

BanyanDB has built-in support for metrics collection. Currently, there are two supported metrics provider: `prometheus` and `native`. These can be enabled through `observability-modes` flag, allowing you to activate one or both of them.

### Prometheus

Prometheus is auto enabled at run time, if no flag is passed or if `promethus` is set in `observability-modes` flag.

When the Prometheus metrics provider is enabled, the metrics server listens on port `2121`. This allows Prometheus to scrape metrics data from BanyanDB for monitoring and analysis.

#### Grafana Dashboard

Check out the [BanyanDB Cluster Dashboard](grafana-cluster.json) for monitoring BanyanDB metrics.

### Native

If the `observability-modes` flag is set to `native`, the self-observability metrics provider will be enabled. The some of metrics will be displayed in the dashboard of [banyandb-ui](http://localhost:17913/) 

![dashboard](https://skywalking.apache.org/doc-graph/banyandb/v0.7.0/dashboard.png)

#### Metrics storage

In self-observability, the metrics data is stored in BanyanDB within the ` _monitoring` internal group. Each metric will be created as a new `measure` within this group.

You can use BanyanDB-UI or bydbctl to retrieve the data.

#### Write Flow

When starting any node, the `_monitoring` internal group will be created, and the metrics will be created as measures within this group. All metric values will be collected and written together at a configurable fixed interval. For a data node, it will write metric values to its own shard using a local pipeline. For a liaison node, it will use nodeSelector to select a data node to write its metric data.

![self-observability-write](https://skywalking.apache.org/doc-graph/banyandb/v0.7.0/self-observability-write.png)

#### Read Flow

The read flow is the same as reading data from `measure`, with each metric being a new measure.

## Profiling

Banyand, the server of BanyanDB, supports profiling automatically. The profiling data is collected by the `pprof` package and can be accessed through the `/debug/pprof` endpoint. The port of the profiling server is `2122` by default.

## Query Tracing

BanyanDB supports query tracing, which allows you to trace the execution of a query. The tracing data includes the query plan, execution time, and other useful information. You can enable query tracing by setting the `QueryRequest.trace` field to `true` when sending a query request.

The below command could query data in the last 30 minutes with `trace` enabled:

```shell
bydbctl measure query --start -30m -f - <<EOF
name: "service_cpm_minute"
groups: ["measure-minute"]
tagProjection:
  tagFamilies:
    - name: "storage-only"
      tags: ["entity_id"]
fieldProjection:
  names: ["total", "value"]
trace: true
EOF
```

The result will include the tracing data in the response. The duration time unit is in nano seconds.
